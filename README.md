# CASE Demo invoicing app

This is a simple demo of an invoicing app built with [CASE](https://case.app).

We are using [jspdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf) to generate PDFs from the data collected.

The project has 2 entities: **Customers** and **Invoices**

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Serve the app

```
npm start
```

Voil√† ! Your application is accessible at http://localhost:4000.

## Create an entity

```
npm run case:entity my-entity
```

Check out the [docs](https://docs.case.app) to help you create your CASE application.
