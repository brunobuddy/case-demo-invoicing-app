# CASE Demo invoicing app

This is a simple demo of an invoicing app built with [CASE](https://case.app).

We are using [jspdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf) to generate PDFs from the data collected.

The project has 2 entities: **Customers** and **Invoices**

## Install

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm start
```

When cloning the app, the DB is empty by default. You can add data by doing:

```bash
# Seeds dummy data in DB
npm run seed
```

You can use the following credentials:<br/>
email: **user1@case.app**<br/>
password: **case**

Voil√† ! Your application is accessible at http://localhost:4000.

## Create an entity

Run this command replacing `my-entity` by your entity name (customers, projects, cats...)

```bash
# Creates a new my-entity.entity.ts file
npm run case:entity my-entity
```
